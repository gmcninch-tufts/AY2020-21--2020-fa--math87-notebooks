    "(non-linear) equations $$f(x) = 0$$ The various methods we describe\n",
    "have different assumptions and requirements.\n",

    "By a root of $f$, we just mean a real number $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) =\n",
    "0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, for some very special functions $f$, we have formulas for\n",

    "\n",
    "The [bisection algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method) permits one\n",
    "to approximate a root of a continuous function \\\\(f\\\\), provided that\n",
    "one knows points \\\\(x_L < x_R\\\\) in the domain of \\\\(f\\\\) for which\n",
    "the function values $f(x_L)$ and $f(x_R)$ are non-zero and have\n",
    "opposite signs. The algorithm then returns an approximate root in the\n",
    "interval \\\\((x_L,x_R)\\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, for a continuous \\\\(f\\\\) the [*intermediate value\n",
    "theorem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem)\n",
    "implies that there is at least one root $x_0$ of $f$ in the interval\n",
    "$(x_L,x_R)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find a root, the algorithm iteratively divides the interval\n",
    "$[x_L,x_R]$ into two sub-intervals by introducing the midpoint $x_C =\n",
    "\\dfrac{x_L + x_R}{2}$. It examines the signs of the values $f(x_L)$,\n",
    "$f(x_C)$ and $f(x_R)$ and discards the interval on which the sign\n",
    "doesn't change. (Of course, if $f(x_C)$ happens to be zero, that is\n",
    "the root!)\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, if $f(x_L)$ and $f(x_C)$ differ in sign, the procedure\n",
    "is repeated on this smaller interval $[x_L,x_C]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One specifies in advance the number $N$ of iterations of this\n",
    "algorithm. After $N$ iterations, the algorithm returns the midpoint of\n",
    "the interval, and that number is taken as the approximate root.\n",

    "even though nothing really gets “shipped” to these nodes.\n",

    "sure to use descriptive variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Input your model into matlab and use the linprog command to solve\n",

    "4. Next, consider the following variants. Assume that shipping workers\n",
    "in LA are unhappy and considering to strike. They demand that all\n",
    "shipping costs to LA be doubled, otherwise they strike and the maximum\n",
    "number of supplies that can be shipped on each route is cut in half\n",
    "(i.e., from 200 to 100). Model both scenarios and see which one\n",

    "goods being made and sold.  The following table shows the profit made\n",
    "at each city from selling 1 rubber duck. Note that in the warehouse\n",
    "cities, you are making the goods, which is a cost instead of a\n",

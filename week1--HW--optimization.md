## (1.1) An optimization question in auto manufacturing

An automobile manufacturer makes a profit of $1,500 per unit on the
sale of a certain model. It is estimated that for every $100 of
rebate, the number of units sold in a given month will increase by 15%.

a. What amount of rebate will maximize profit for the month? Model as
a one-variable optimization problem.

b. Compute the sensitivity of your answer to the 15%
assumption. Consider both the amount of rebate and the resulting
profit.

c. Suppose that rebates actually generate only a 10% increase in sales
per $100. What is the effect? What if the response is somewhere
between 10 and 15% per $100 of rebate?

d. Under what circumstances would a rebate offer cause a reduction in
  profit?


## (1.2) Blood typing


$$\int_0^\infty f(x)dx$$



Human blood is generally classified in the “ABO” system, with four
blood types: `A`, `B`, `O`, and `AB`. These four types reflect six
gene pairs (genotypes), with blood type `A` corresponding to gene
pairs `AA` and `AO`, blood type `B` corresponding to gene pairs `BB`
and `BO`, blood type `O` corresponding to gene pair `OO`, and blood
type `AB` corresponding to gene pair `AB`. Let $p$  be the proportion of
gene `A` in the population, $q$ be the proportion of gene `B` in the
population, and $r$ be the proportion of gene `O` in the population. Note
that $p + q + r = 1$.

a. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that $p$, $q$, and
$r$ are fixed from generation to generation, as are the
frequencies of the different genotypes. Under this assumption, what is
the probability that an individual has genotype `AA`? `BB`? `OO`? What
is the probability of an individual having two different genes?

b. Find the maximum percentage of the population that can have two
different genes under the Hardy-Weinberg principle in two different
ways, by directly maximizing a function of only two variables and by
using the method of Lagrange multipliers.

c. Can you say what the Lagrange multiplier represents in the above
example?
